All files necessary to run the game, as well as all assets, source code and project files created during the GGJ and necessary to rebuild/compile & link the game from scratch must be uploaded as well. Third party tools, libraries, engines and assets that are used for the game, but not created during the GGJ, may be omitted from the GGJ project submission. However, clear instructions must be included on how to purchase or obtain these resources in order to continue development on the game.

If you see a game being created, or find a game on our site which would violate these terms email help@globalgamejam.org or fill in this form (can be submitted anonymously).

ORGANIZERS USE OF GGJ LOGO AND USE OF GLOBAL GAME JAM®
Once a location is approved on the GGJ website, the organizer understands the requirements of GGJ and agrees to abide by the rules of Global Game Jam® and use the trademark and logo responsibly and will update their site, media releases and communication accordingly. To be part of Global Game Jam®, all locations must state on their website, media outings and other communications, that their location or local jam is part of the official Global Game Jam® and will use the Global Game Jam® logo provided by GGJ. The organizers will make sure to connect their registration platform of choice (i.e. Eventbrite, Ticketmaster, etc.) and their local webite will refer to the Global Game Jam® website (http://www.globalgamejam.org).

Use of the GGJ logo
Third parties may not use the Global Game Jam® logo without expressed written permission. The logo must always be accompanied with the words “Global Game Jam” and linked directly to “globalgamejam.org”. It must not be used for any purpose other than to identify the Global Game Jam®.

Global Game Jam® Policy on becoming a jam site
One of the things that make the GGJ unique, is that we require all jammers to participate from an approved location. A jam site will typically, but not always, be open to anyone who wants to participate. Most GGJ sites tend to be companies, co-working spaces or universities.

We discourage use of private residences and very rarely approve them. 

It is not possible to participate in GGJ as a jammer without being associated to a physical approved site. This means we do not accept virtual sites or remote participants as a default.

All GGJ sites must, at minimum, provide free Internet access and space to set up and work comfortably.

Global Game Jam® Policy on attending as a jammer
To participate in the Global Game Jam event, you must be a legal adult in the country in which you attend the GGJ. See our age policy.

On-site Advertising Policy
Evangelists, salespeople, or any company employee, provided they are NOT advertising a product, are completely welcome to participate in Global Game Jam at any site.

If a company wants an evangelist, salesperson, or any company employee to advertise their product at a single Global Game Jam location, they must give support to that site in some way, whether in-kind or financial.

If a company wants evangelists, salespeople, or any company employees to advertise their products at multiple Global Game Jam locations, they must be a sponsor of Global Game Jam Inc.

GGJ Research
GGJ conducts studies and research related to each global Game Jam event. GGJ research strives to explore, understand and grow the art of games and game jamming. We endeavor to protect the rights, welfare, and well-being of subjects involved in research conducted or supported by Global Game Jam® and the various researchers by adhering to strict legal and ethical protocols. Research is primarily conducted via survey, or observation. GGJ participants may choose to opt-out of interviews and observations by advising their local organizers or by not taking the survey.

Age Policy
No person may participate in a Global Game Jam event® unless they have reached 18 years of age or the age of majority (e.g. are legal adults) in the country of participation (whichever is younger). As an example, participants attending a GGJ site in Scotland or Cuba, must be 16 years of age or older to participate as that is the age of majority, while participants that join a site in the United States, New Zealand or Japan must be 18+ to attend.

The only exception to this rule, is if the minor is accompanied by a legal guardian at all times while attending the jam.

Modification
The Global Game Jam® reserves the right to change, modify or make exceptions to all policies at will.

By participating in GGJ or using the GGJ website you accept and abide by the policies stated above. Please contact us (info@globalgamejam.org) with any questions.
